# Simple neural network in c++

> I'm not pretending to be the author of this idea. Original was lost on "Vimeo" - video hosting platform. I'm just using in learning purposes.

## Fast run

To see this neural network in work immediately you can go to my repl project on [Repl.it](https://repl.it/) (There is only on training data sample):

[SpekalsG3/Neural Network](https://repl.it/@SpekalsG3Play/Neural-Network)

## Installation

Use following command to clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SpekalsG3/NeuralNetworkCPP.git
```

Then go to created folder:

```bash
cd NeuralNetworkCPP
```

Now you can either run this neural network in development environment or compile it using mingw:

```bash
g++ -o main main.cpp network.cpp neuron.cpp trainingdata.cpp
```

Running executable file follow instructions and enjoy.

## Utils

There is "trainingdatasample.cpp" which you can compile, run executable and create your own sample with trainingdata
